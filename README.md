What Happens When You Type “https://www.google.com" in Your Browser and Press Enter
====================

Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type a URL like “https://www.google.com" in your web browser and hit Enter? This seemingly simple action triggers a complex series of processes, involving various components and technologies. In this blog post, we’ll take you through the journey of a URL from your browser to Google’s servers, explaining each step along the way.


DNS Request
-----------

The journey begins when you type “https://www.google.com" into your browser’s address bar and hit Enter. The first thing your browser does is send a DNS (Domain Name System) request to resolve the human-readable domain name, “www.google.com," into an IP address. DNS is like a phonebook for the internet, translating domain names into IP addresses.

- Your browser first checks its local cache. If it has previously resolved the domain, it can skip the following steps.
- If not found in the cache, your browser sends a request to a DNS resolver. This is typically provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a third-party DNS resolver like Google’s 8.8.8.8. The DNS resolver serves as an intermediary in the resolution process.
- The DNS resolver may have the answer in its cache. If not, it begins the resolution process by sending a request to the root DNS servers. These servers know the IP addresses of the authoritative DNS servers for each top-level domain (TLD). In this case, it queries for the IP address of the “.com” TLD.
- The root DNS server responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for the “.com” TLD.
- The resolver then queries the authoritative DNS server for the “google.com” domain, and it responds with the IP address of Google’s servers.

```python
# Pseudocode for DNS Resolution
if 'google.com' not in browser_cache:
    query = create_dns_query('google.com')
    response = dns_resolver.resolve(query)
    ip_address = response.get_ip_address()
    browser_cache['google.com'] = ip_address
```

URL Parsing
-----------

User Input: The process commences when a user enters “https://www.google.com" in their browser’s address bar and hits Enter.
URL Parsing: The browser parses the URL to extract the scheme (“https”), domain (“www.google.com"), and path (typically “/”). These components are used for further actions.

```
URL: https://www.google.com/
Scheme: https
Domain: www.google.com
Path: /
```

DNS Lookup
----------
- DNS Request: The browser initiates a DNS lookup to resolve the domain “www.google.com" to an IP address.
- Local DNS Cache: It first checks its local DNS cache for a previously resolved IP address. If not found, it proceeds with a DNS resolution request.
- Root Servers: In case of a cache miss, the browser sends a DNS query to the local DNS resolver, which may have the IP for “www.google.com" cached. If not, the resolver queries the root DNS servers to locate the “.com” TLD’s authoritative DNS servers.
- TLD Servers: The root servers reply with the “.com” TLD servers. The resolver queries the “.com” TLD servers.
- Authoritative DNS Servers: The “.com” TLD servers return the IP addresses of Google’s authoritative DNS servers.
- Google’s DNS Servers: The DNS resolver queries one of Google’s authoritative DNS servers, which returns the IP address for “www.google.com."

TCP/IP Connection
-----------------

TCP/IP Connection: The browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the resolved IP address.
Three-way Handshake: A three-way handshake occurs between the browser and the web server to establish a reliable connection.

Contacting the Authoritative DNS Server
---------------------------------------

Once the DNS resolver determines the authoritative DNS server for google.com, it queries that server to retrieve the IP address. The authoritative DNS server holds this critical information, and it responds with the IP address associated with google.com.
```python
# Pseudocode for Contacting the Authoritative DNS Server
authoritative_server = get_authoritative_dns_server('google.com')
query = create_dns_query('google.com')
response = authoritative_server.resolve(query)
ip_address = response.get_ip_address()
```

Browser Request
---------------

With the IP address in hand, your browser can now send an HTTP request to Google’s web server using the obtained IP address. It sends a request packet over the internet, specifying that it wants to connect to google.com.

When the request reaches a Google server, it goes through several stages:

- Parsing: The server parses the HTTP request to understand what the browser is asking for. It checks the request method (e.g., GET or POST), headers, and parameters.
- Request Processing: The server determines what content to serve based on the request. In this case, it’s the Google homepage.
- Data Retrieval: The server fetches the necessary data, which may include HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and other assets required to render the web page.
- Generating Response: The server generates an HTTP response, including the requested content, HTTP headers (like caching directives), and status codes (e.g., 200 OK).
- Sending the Response: The server sends the response back to your browser.

```
# Pseudocode for Handling the Request
http_request = receive_request()
response = process_request(http_request)
send_response(response)
```

Caching — Enhancing Performance
-------------------------------

Caching plays a crucial role in speeding up the loading process. Your browser and Google’s servers use caching mechanisms:

Browser Caching: Your browser stores elements of the web page, like images and scripts, in its cache. When you revisit the same page, it can use these cached resources, reducing the need to fetch them again.
Server Caching: Google’s servers also employ caching. Commonly accessed resources are stored in cache servers located closer to the user, reducing latency.

```
# Pseudocode for Caching
if resource not in browser_cache:
    resource = fetch_resource_from_server(resource_url)
    browser_cache[resource_url] = resource
```

Firewall
--------

Firewall: The request might need to pass through a firewall, which is responsible for security. Firewalls filter traffic to ensure it’s safe and authorized.

HTTPS/SSL Handshake
-------------------

HTTPS/SSL Handshake: In the case of HTTPS, a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake occurs. The browser and the server negotiate encryption parameters, exchange keys, and verify the server’s authenticity.

Secure Connection: Once the SSL/TLS handshake is complete, the communication between the browser and server becomes encrypted, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

```
# Pseudocode for HTTPS Handshake
ssl_socket = create_ssl_socket()
ssl_socket.handshake()
```

Load Balancing — Ensuring Reliability
-------------------------------------

Google’s web servers are distributed across multiple data centers to ensure reliability and reduce latency. Load balancing is a crucial step that directs incoming requests to the most suitable server. This is achieved using various load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin, least-connections, and IP hashing. The goal is to evenly distribute traffic, optimize server usage, and prevent overloading any one server.

Load balancers also perform health checks on the servers. If a server becomes unresponsive, it is temporarily removed from the pool, ensuring that user requests are routed to functioning servers.

```
# Pseudocode for Load Balancing
selected_server = load_balancer.choose_server()
response = selected_server.process_request(http_request)
```

Web Server
----------

The web server is the component that serves web pages and processes HTTP requests. In Google’s case, the web server will receive your request and send back the HTML and other resources needed to render the Google search page in your browser.


Application Server
------------------

The web server may need to interact with application servers for more complex tasks. In Google’s case, these application servers handle various features like search algorithms, personalized results, and user interactions. The web server communicates with these application servers to generate dynamic content.

Continuous Monitoring — SRE’s Vigilance
---------------------------------------

Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) are constantly monitoring Google’s services. They use a combination of tools and practices to ensure performance and reliability:

- Real-time Traffic Analysis: SREs analyze incoming traffic patterns to detect anomalies or unusual behavior.
- Automated Alerting: Systems are set up to generate alerts if predefined thresholds or conditions are met, indicating potential issues.
- Performance Metrics: Various metrics, such as response time, server load, and error rates, are continuously monitored to gauge service health.

Disaster Recovery — Prepared for the Unexpected
-----------------------------------------------

SREs are well-prepared for unexpected events:
- Redundancy: Google has redundant infrastructure to minimize service interruptions. If one data center experiences issues, traffic is redirected to another.
- Failover Mechanisms: Automated failover mechanisms ensure that if a server or data center becomes unavailable, traffic is redirected to backups.
- Backups: Regular backups are maintained to recover data in the event of data loss or corruption.

```
# Pseudocode for Disaster Recovery
if server.is_unresponsive():
    server.switch_to_backup()
```

Database
--------

Behind the scenes, Google’s application servers often rely on databases to store and retrieve data. Databases play a crucial role in managing user accounts, storing search histories, and serving personalized content.

Page Rendering
--------------

Page Rendering: The web server generates an HTML response, possibly combining data from various sources. This response is encrypted and sent back to the browser through the established TCP/IP connection.

Browser Rendering: The browser receives the response, decrypts it, and renders the webpage for the user to see and interact with.
```
// Pseudocode for Rendering the Page
html = response.get_html_content()
dom_tree = parse_html(html)
render(dom_tree)
fetch_and render_css(response.get_css_links())
fetch_and execute_js(response.get_js_links())
```


Rendering the Page — Your Browser’s Role
-----------------------------------------
Upon receiving the response, your browser takes over:

- Parsing HTML: Your browser parses the HTML content to create a Document Object Model (DOM). This is a structured representation of the web page’s content and structure.
- Rendering: It uses the DOM and the associated CSS to render the web page on your screen. This includes arranging elements, applying styles, and rendering images.
- Executing JavaScript: If the web page includes JavaScript, your browser executes it. JavaScript can add interactivity and dynamically modify the page.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Google</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Google's search bar and other page contents -->
</body>
</html>
```
The journey from typing “google.com” in your browser and pressing Enter is a multifaceted process, orchestrated by DNS resolution, load balancing, server processing, secure connections, and ongoing monitoring. The collaborative efforts of both systems and Site Reliability Engineers ensure a seamless and secure user experience when accessing websites like Google. This elaborate choreography, hidden from the end user, exemplifies the intricacies of modern internet architecture and the diligent work of SREs to keep it all running smoothly
